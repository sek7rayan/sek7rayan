# 👋 Hi there, I'm [Rayan Sekfali]! 👋

## About Me

My name is [Rayan Sekfali]. I am a Cybersecurity student and a Backend Developer with a strong focus on building reliable and secure systems.  

I have solid experience in backend development, particularly in designing and implementing **CRUD applications** and management systems. I am comfortable working with databases, creating RESTful APIs, and applying the **MVP (Model–View–Presenter) architecture** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable projects. I enjoy structuring backend logic and writing efficient code that solves real-world problems.  

Alongside development, I am deeply interested in **Cybersecurity**. Lately, I have dedicated much of my time to Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and security challenges, which allow me to sharpen both my technical and problem-solving skills.  

My long-term goal is to **combine backend development with cybersecurity**, because I strongly believe that modern software must not only be functional and efficient but also **secure by design**. This intersection is where I see myself growing and making the most impact.
